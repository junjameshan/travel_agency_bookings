## Introduction / Background 

A travel booking agency is looking into the total bookings that one of their advisor user has completed for the year of 2022 and 2023 so far. Working as a Data Analyst on the Marketing Analytics team, you want to be able to provide insights into the business performance of the advisor user for the Marketing Director.

A few examples of insights that the Marketing Director as well as the advisor user wants to see are: 

- Booking trends over time 
- Value of completed vs. canceled vs. pending bookings
- Top clients
- Top suppliers 
- Bookings with travel (arrival date) coming up in the next 2 weeks 
- Completed but unpaid bookings
